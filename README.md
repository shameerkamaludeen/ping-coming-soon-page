## Overview

If you have done most of the other Newbie level challenges from Frontend Mentor this challenge isn't much different from those. As the challenge wasn't much different I was able to concentrate on getting familiarized with the process, maybe that is what the challenge intended for.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Submit their email address using an `input` field
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
	- The `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"Whoops! It looks like you forgot to add your email"*
	- The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Please provide a valid email address"*

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

This time I was focused on writing the styles and code by myself instead of looking much at the reference, this may help reduce the time needed to complete the project in the future as getting familiarized with the code.

### Continued development

Thinking to code without much help from the reference if we had done those designs or code before.
